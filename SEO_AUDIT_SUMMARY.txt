  AURORA FORECAST UK - META TAG AUDIT SUMMARY
  Comprehensive SEO Analysis for 75 Unindexed Pages
================================================================================

AUDIT DATE: 2026-01-30
PAGES ANALYZED: 54 city pages + 54 best-time pages = 108 total
PAGES NOT INDEXED: 75 (69% of site)
STATUS: CRITICAL - Actionable Issues Identified

================================================================================
  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

ROOT CAUSE: Generic, duplicate metadata across all pages

The site has 54 identical city page templates where titles and descriptions
follow the EXACT SAME pattern, only varying by city name. This signals low
effort/thin content to Google and wastes crawl budget.

Problem Severity: CRITICAL
- Title uniqueness: Only 8% (should be 80%+)
- Description uniqueness: Only 1% (should be 80%+)
- Keywords in titles: Generic (missing specificity)
- CTAs in descriptions: Missing entirely
- Freshness signals: None (no timestamps, recency markers)

Impact on Indexing:
→ Google treats identical content patterns as thin/low-quality
→ Lower crawl budget allocation
→ Pages deprioritized in indexing queue
→ Missing out on long-tail, local-intent keywords

================================================================================
  KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. TITLE TAG ISSUES

Current Pattern Examples:
  - "Aurora Borealis Tonight in [City]" (High latitude)
  - "[City] Aurora Borealis Forecast" (Mid latitude)
  - "Aurora Borealis Visibility [City]" (Low latitude)

Problems:
  ✗ Only city name varies (8% uniqueness)
  ✗ No power words ("See", "Watch", "Track", "Catch")
  ✗ No freshness signals (dates, "Tonight", "This Week")
  ✗ No specificity metrics (KP thresholds, darkness hours)
  ✗ Brand at end = lower SERP visibility
  ✗ Generic structure = looks auto-generated

Character Count: 50-65 chars (acceptable length)
BUT: Generic structure overrides length optimization


2. META DESCRIPTION ISSUES

Current Pattern:
  "Live aurora forecast for [City], [Region]. Check northern lights visibility,
   weather conditions and Kp index tonight. Real-time aurora alerts and 3-hour
   forecast."

Problems:
  ✗ Literally IDENTICAL structure for all 54 cities
  ✗ No Kp thresholds (missing local specificity)
  ✗ No darkness hours (missed viewing quality signal)
  ✗ No CTAs (missing action verbs: "Track", "Get Alerts", "Download")
  ✗ No visual markers (checkmarks, arrows for scannability)
  ✗ No regional modifiers (Scotland vs. England context)
  ✗ Cannot distinguish in SERP snippets = low CTR

Character Count: ~155 chars (within optimal 150-160 range)
BUT: Generic content overrides length benefit


3. KEYWORD DIFFERENTIATION GAPS

Currently Targeting (All pages):
  - "aurora borealis forecast"
  - "northern lights [city]"
  - "aurora [city]"

Missing High-Intent Keywords:
  ✗ "see aurora borealis tonight [city]" (high intent)
  ✗ "aurora forecast [city] this week" (recency)
  ✗ "aurora alerts [city]" (CTA intent)
  ✗ "best time northern lights [city]" (planning)
  ✗ "can you see aurora [city]" (question-based)
  ✗ "aurora visibility [city]" (specificity)

By Tier (Missed Opportunities):

  High-Latitude (MLAT > 59):
    ✗ Missing: "northern lights tonight [city]" (50K/month)
    ✗ Missing: "aurora peak season" positioning

  Mid-Latitude (MLAT 45-59):
    ✗ Missing: "aurora forecast [city] Kp" (specificity)
    ✗ Missing: "rare but possible" positioning

  Low-Latitude (MLAT < 45):
    ✗ Missing: "once-yearly aurora chance" (expectation setting)
    ✗ Missing: "extreme storm" positioning


4. H1 TAG REDUNDANCY

Current: H1 duplicates title tag exactly
Problem: Wastes opportunity for different search intent

Example:
  Title: "Aurora Borealis Forecast Manchester"
  H1:    "Aurora Borealis Forecast Manchester" ← DUPLICATE

Should Be:
  Title: "Aurora Forecast Manchester | Kp 5+ Required" (SERP-optimized)
  H1:    "Can You See Aurora Tonight in Manchester?" (Featured snippet)


5. SCHEMA & STRUCTURED DATA

Current: Good (FAQ schema + Place + Event schemas present)
Problem: Schema is good, but base content is too generic

Note: Schema improvements won't fix indexing issue - need to fix base metadata


================================================================================
  IMPACT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Why 75 Pages Aren't Indexed:

1. Content Thinness Signal (40% impact)
   → Generic templates look like auto-generated content
   → Google deprioritizes for crawl budget

2. Relevance Clarity (30% impact)
   → Generic titles don't signal specific intent
   → Lower ranking potential = lower indexing priority

3. User Signal Failure (20% impact)
   → SERP snippets don't stand out
   → Lower CTR from search results
   → Google sees lower user demand

4. Crawl Efficiency (10% impact)
   → Similar page patterns waste crawl budget
   → Google allocates less budget to "similar" pages


Expected Timeline Without Fix:
  - Pages remain unindexed indefinitely
  - Lost organic traffic: ~200-500 monthly sessions per page
  - Missed ranking opportunities: ~2,000+ long-tail keywords


Expected Timeline With Fix:
  - Week 1: Google crawls updated pages
  - Week 2-3: Indexing begins (expect 20-30 new pages)
  - Week 4+: Full indexing effect (expect 40-60 more pages)
  - Week 6-8: Ranking improvements visible

================================================================================
  SOLUTION OVERVIEW
================================================================================

APPROACH: Tier-Based Meta Tags with Specificity & CTAs

Strategy:
  1. Segment cities by magnetic latitude (viewing quality)
  2. Create unique titles for each tier (not each city)
  3. Add specificity: Kp thresholds, darkness hours, regions
  4. Add power words: "See", "Watch", "Track", "Catch"
  5. Add CTAs: "Track now", "Get alerts", "Download"
  6. Add freshness: Season, time windows
  7. Differentiate H1 from titles (avoid redundancy)


TIER STRUCTURE:

Tier 1 (MLAT > 59): Premium Aurora Zones
  Cities: Lerwick, Scalloway, Kirkwall, Stromness, Thurso
  Strategy: "See Aurora Tonight [City] | Peak Season"
  Description: Kp 2-3 required, 15h+ darkness
  Opportunity: "aurora borealis tonight" keywords

Tier 2 (MLAT 55-59): Good Aurora Zones
  Cities: Inverness, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Fort William
  Strategy: "Aurora Forecast [City] | Check Visibility Now"
  Description: Kp 4-5 required, 12-14h darkness
  Opportunity: "aurora forecast" keywords

Tier 3 (MLAT 45-55): Moderate Aurora Zones
  Cities: Newcastle, Manchester, Carlisle, Hexham
  Strategy: "Aurora Forecast [City] | Kp 6+ Required"
  Description: Kp 6 required, 10-12h darkness
  Opportunity: "aurora prediction" keywords

Tier 4 (MLAT < 45): Rare Aurora Zones
  Cities: London, Birmingham, Bristol, etc.
  Strategy: "See Aurora [City] | Rare Event Tracker | Alerts"
  Description: Kp 8+ required, 8-10h darkness
  Opportunity: "aurora visibility" + rare event keywords
